# Stellar Arena - Testing Guide (Phase 1)

## How to Run the Game

1. Open Godot 4.5 Editor
2. Load this project
3. Press **F5** or click "Run Project" to start
4. The game will automatically load into a test combat scenario

## What You Should See

### Visual Elements
- **Hex Grid**: 15Ã—15 hexagonal grid (greenish/blue hexagons)
- **Player Ships**: 2 ships on the left side (normal color from sprites)
- **Enemy Ships**: 2 ships on the right side (red-tinted)
- **Selection Indicator**: Blue circle appears under selected ship
- **UI Panels**:
  - Bottom-left: Ship info panel (hull, shields, energy, AP)
  - Top-right: Turn order panel (shows initiative order)
  - Bottom-right: "End Turn" button
  - Top-center: Status message showing whose turn it is

### Test Combat Setup
- **Player Team**: 2 Corvettes (balanced medium ships)
  - Position: Grid cells (3,3) and (4,3)
  - Stats: 100 hull, 50 shields, 4 AP, 4 movement range
- **Enemy Team**: 2 Interceptors (fast, light ships)
  - Position: Grid cells (10,7) and (11,7)
  - Stats: 60 hull, 30 shields, 5 AP, 6 movement range
  - **Note**: Currently just skip their turns (no AI yet)

## Controls

### Mouse Controls
- **Left-click on your ship**: Select it (shows movement range in green)
- **Left-click on green hex**: Move your ship there (consumes AP)
- **Left-click on non-highlighted hex**: Does nothing
- **Hover over ship**: Slight brightness increase

### Keyboard Controls
- **Space** or **Enter**: End your turn
- **ESC**: Deselect current ship

## What to Test

### 1. Ship Selection
- [ ] Click on your ships - selection indicator appears
- [ ] Ship info panel updates to show selected ship's stats
- [ ] Movement range highlights in green
- [ ] ESC deselects ship and clears highlights

### 2. Movement
- [ ] Select a ship
- [ ] Click on a green highlighted hex
- [ ] Ship smoothly animates to destination
- [ ] AP decreases based on distance moved
- [ ] Can move multiple times per turn until AP runs out
- [ ] Cannot move to cells outside green range

### 3. Turn System
- [ ] Turn order displays correctly in top-right panel
- [ ] Current ship is highlighted in turn order
- [ ] Status message shows current ship's turn
- [ ] Clicking "End Turn" advances to next ship
- [ ] After all ships take turns, new round starts
- [ ] Initiative re-rolls each round (turn order may change)

### 4. Visual Feedback
- [ ] Ships display correctly with sprites
- [ ] Player ships appear normal
- [ ] Enemy ships have red tint
- [ ] Selected ship has blue circle underneath
- [ ] Hull/shield/energy bars update correctly
- [ ] Cell hover shows slight highlight

### 5. Grid Interaction
- [ ] Can click on any cell
- [ ] Cells change color on hover
- [ ] Selected ship's current cell is visible
- [ ] Grid is properly centered in camera view

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

### Expected Behaviors
- **Enemy AI**: Enemies skip their turns immediately (AI not implemented yet)
- **No Combat**: Ships cannot attack or damage each other
- **No Win Condition**: Combat never ends (no victory/defeat)
- **No Weapons**: Ships have no way to interact beyond movement
- **Ship Visibility**: Ships should now be visible with sprites!

### Expected NOT to Work
- Attacking enemies
- Enemy movement/actions
- Crew abilities
- Energy management (energy regenerates but isn't used)
- Status effects
- Hazards
- Ship destruction

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Ships Not Visible
- **Check**: Sprite files exist in `srpites/ships/` folder
- **Check**: .import files were generated by Godot
- **Fix**: Close and reopen Godot to force reimport

### Can't Click Ships
- **Issue**: Collision shape may not be set up
- **Check**: Ship scene has Area3D with CollisionShape3D
- **Test**: Try clicking near the ship's position

### Movement Range Not Showing
- **Fix**: Click directly on the ship (not near it)
- **Fix**: Make sure it's that ship's turn

### Camera View Wrong
- **Issue**: Camera may need adjustment
- **Fix**: In Godot editor, adjust Camera3D position in combat_arena.tscn

### UI Not Updating
- **Check**: Combat HUD is initialized in combat_manager
- **Fix**: Verify signals are connected properly

## Performance Check

Expected performance on modern hardware:
- **FPS**: 60 fps (smooth)
- **Grid Generation**: < 1 second on load
- **Movement Animation**: Smooth interpolation
- **UI Updates**: Instant

If performance is poor:
- Reduce grid size in GridManager (try 10Ã—10)
- Check if debug mode is slowing things down

## Debug Information

### Console Output
The game prints useful debug info to console:
- "Turn started: [Ship Name] (Team X)"
- "Turn ended: [Ship Name]"
- "Movement completed: [Ship Name] moved to (x,y)"
- "Combat ended! Winner: Team X"

### Enabling Debug Features
In `grid_manager.gd`, set:
```gdscript
show_coordinates = true
```
This will display hex coordinates on each cell.

## Next Steps for Testing

Once basic movement works:
1. Test movement edge cases (blocked paths, occupied cells)
2. Verify AP costs are correct
3. Check turn order changes between rounds
4. Test ESC key deselection
5. Verify UI updates in real-time

## Reporting Issues

When testing, note:
- What you were doing
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Any console errors

## Success Criteria (Phase 1)

Phase 1 is successful if you can:
- [x] See the hex grid
- [x] See all 4 ships with sprites
- [x] Select your ships
- [x] Move your ships around the grid
- [x] See AP decrease as you move
- [x] End your turn
- [x] See turn order cycle through ships
- [x] UI updates correctly
