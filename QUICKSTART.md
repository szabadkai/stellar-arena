## Known Behaviors (Phase 1)

**Expected:**

- Enemies skip turns immediately (no AI)
- No combat/weapons yet
- Game never ends (no win condition)
- Energy regenerates but isn't used
- Ships can't attack

**Not a Bug:**

- Enemy turns are instant
- Ships don't die
- No damage numbers
- Grid coordinates hidden (set `show_coordinates = true` in grid_manager.gd to see them)

## Troubleshooting

**Ships not visible?**

- Check sprites exist in `srpites/ships/` folder
- Verify .import files were created
- Try closing and reopening Godot

**Can't click ships?**

- Click directly on ship position
- Make sure Area3D collision is enabled

**Movement not working?**

- Ensure it's that ship's turn
- Check ship has AP remaining
- Verify cell is in green range

**UI not showing?**

- Check console for errors
- Verify combat_hud initialized properly

**Performance issues?**

- Press F2 to see FPS
- Should be 60 FPS on modern hardware
- Check console for warnings

## Console Debug Output

The game prints helpful info to console:

```
Turn started: Corvette (Team 0)
Movement completed: Corvette moved to (5,4)
Turn ended: Corvette
Turn started: Interceptor (Team 1)
```

## Next Phase Preview

Once you verify Phase 1 works, Phase 2 will add:

- **Weapon systems** (kinetic, energy, missiles)
- **Combat damage** with shields/armor
- **Enemy AI** that actually moves and fights
- **Ship destruction** and victory conditions

## Tips for Testing

1. **Try edge cases**: Move to grid edges, try invalid moves
2. **Test AP limits**: Move until you run out of AP
3. **Round transitions**: Play several rounds to see initiative changes
4. **UI responsiveness**: Click around rapidly, test all buttons
5. **Visual clarity**: Can you easily see what's happening?

## Performance Baseline

Expected on modern hardware:

- **FPS**: 60 (solid)
- **Grid generation**: < 500ms
- **Movement animation**: Smooth
- **UI updates**: Instant
- **Turn transitions**: < 100ms
